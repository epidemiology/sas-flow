{"name":"sas-flow","tagline":"An opinionated SAS workflow for better organization, collaboration, and multi-platform support.","body":"I created `sas-flow` with a few goals in mind:\r\n\r\n- **Organization:** I wanted a better way to organize my SAS code than putting everything in one monolithic file, or a bunch of separate, unconnected files.\r\n- **Collaboration:** It should be easy to share SAS code within a team of collaborators.\r\n- **Reproducibility:** It should be easy to re-run an analysis and reliably get the same results (no \"where did that number come from?).\r\n- **Tooling:** I wanted to bring state-of-the-art programmer tools to my SAS code, specifically \\[Sublime Text] for editing code and \\[git] for storing it.\r\n- **Good defaults:** I wanted an easy way to apply sensible SAS defaults at the beginning of each new analysis project.\r\n- **Mac support:** I run SAS in a Windows virtual machine on OS X, and I want to use Windows as little as possible. `sas-flow` lets me write my SAS code and view my output in OS X.\r\n\r\nIt will take you about an hour to carefully read through this documentation and understand how `sas-flow` works. __This time investment is 100% worth it.__ `sas-flow` will save you lots of time down the road.\r\n\r\n[Ready to get started?](https://github.com/epidemiology/sas-flow/blob/master/README.md)","google":"UA-40778881-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
