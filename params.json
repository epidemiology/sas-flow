{"name":"sas-flow","tagline":"An opinionated SAS workflow for better organization, collaboration, and multi-platform support.","body":"`sas-flow` was created with a few goals in mind:\r\n\r\n- **Organization:** We need a better way to organize SAS code than putting everything in one monolithic file, or a bunch of separate, unconnected files.\r\n- **Collaboration:** It should be easy to share SAS code within a team of collaborators. Getting started with a `sas-flow` project you have never seen before should be easy and self-explanatory.\r\n- **Reproducibility:** It should be easy to re-run an analysis and reliably get the same results (no \"where did that number come from?\").\r\n- **Tooling:** SAS programmers should have state-of-the-art tools, like a real text editor (e.g. [Sublime Text][1]) for editing code and version control ([git][2]) for storing it.\r\n- **Good defaults:** Sensible SAS defaults should be applied to every project, like setting the working directory appropriately and producing HTML output.\r\n- **Mac support:** Mac users running SAS in a virtual machine should be first-class citizens and should be able to write code and view output in OS X.\r\n\r\nTo this end, `sas-flow` is a project template along with some well-documented guidelines. Together, these create a streamlined SAS workflow that will save time and prevent gray hairs.\r\n\r\n### [Ready to get started?
